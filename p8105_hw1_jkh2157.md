Let’s load the early january weather data set

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

The `early_january_weather` dataset contains **358** hourly observations
and **15** variables collected at Newark Airport (EWR) in early January
2013.

Important variables include:  
- `temp`: temperature in °F (mean value: **39.6** °F)  
- `humid`: relative humidity (%)  
- `time_hour`: timestamp for each hourly measurement

Now I am going to create a scatterplot for temperature v time_hour

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x=time_hour,y=temp, color=humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_jkh2157_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("early_january_weather.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

The scatter plot shows that the temperature generally increased over the
two week period, and that it fluctuated throughout the day (colder ar
night and hotter during the day). Colder temperatures are usually
associated with lower humidity and higher temperatures are usually
associated with higher humidity.
